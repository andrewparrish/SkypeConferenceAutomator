# ABOUT

This is a webapp powered by Flask that uses the Python Package Skype4Py to interact with Skype and allow a user to start/end calls between two Skype clients simply by accessing the Flask webpage. This is useful for companies that may want to make connecting two conference rooms via skype even easier.

# REQUIREMENTS
## IMPORTANT NOTE
You must be using Python 2.7 and Mac OSX. This should also work for various Linux flavors with some configurations of directories. It will not work with Windows without mass changes. 

##Packages
1. Flask
2. Skype4Py-Must be installed on all Skype client computers (or only callers if you decide to use autoanswer=False More on that in Installation)

# INSTALLATION AND SETUP

The first step is to setup the Flask server on your local network. It can then be run simply by using 'python gui.py'. The server by default is set to run on port 5000, but that can be changed in the gui.py file (see [Flask documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/) for more detail).
